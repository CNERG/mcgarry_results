Goals:
-----
Create custom archetypes for EF, sinks that apply social behavior models to trading.
1) EF trades at every X timestep
2) HEU Sink trades at every X timestep
3) EF trades with LEU sink at all timesteps, with HEU sink at only X timestep
4) Trading behavior is controlled by random number generator
5) Adjust preferences so that HEU is traded if offered.  Look for signature in LEU production. And Tails?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0	test_laptop		F8OF	confirm that ef_commod branch has successfully forked to ef_behavior
					  (can trade w/2 facilities and sink specifies incoming material)
        free_trading		06E78	no restrictions on trading (same swu/duration/constraints as #3,4)
1	ef_flagon		227F	EF trades every 5x, sink always trades
2	ef_sink_flagon		E123E	sink trades every 2x and EF every 5x (100 timesteps)
3	new_1leu_5heu		CD566	EF trades every 1 for LEU, every 5 for HEU 
	new_1leu_2heu		33818	EF trades every 1 for LEU, every 2 for HEU 
4	heu_random5		A112F	EF trades every 1 for LEU, randomly 1 in 5 for HEU

*	weird_leu1_heu2_ef5		This one showed failed trading on LEU every 1 in 10.
*	test_swufree   			Investigation demonstrated that trade was SWU limited
*	test_swulimit			when both LEU and HEU were being requested. All normal.

4	sink_heu_random2	49CA2	EF trades every time, HEU sink requests randomly 1 in 2
4	EF_random5_sink_random2	3A57F	EF trades randomly 1 in 5, HEU sink requests randomly 1 in 2
4	random_leu2_heu5_100yrs	518ce	EF trades randomly 1 in 5, HEU sink requests randomly 1 in 2, 100yr duration
					   (final # was 89, just outside of 1 sigma)
4	random_leu2_heu5_100yr2	f7e30	EF trades randomly 1 in 5, HEU sink requests randomly 1 in 2, 100yr duration
					   (final # was 102, inside 1 sigma)
