To run multiple simulations:

./many_sims.sh RS_v12.xml


To run the binary version of cyan (from this directory):

./cyanb -db name.sqlite . . . .


Checking whether CYAN processes the same way that Cylist does toc calculate
inventories, and confirm that state variable time_seed works to seed RNG on
time instead of fixed value.

Analysis is recorded in ipython notebook:
