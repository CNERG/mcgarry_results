Goal
----
Dataset for UM containing power consumption and LEU shipped, where SWU is
not constrained and power consumption has gaussian variation.  Enrichment
level of LEU produced also varies with a discrete # of levels (3-5%).
Possibly also vary HEU amplitude.

Modifications
-------------
1) Create xml with correct facilities to simulate variation in power consumed
due to variation in tails assay.
x    a) variation in LEU Qty requested (gaussian)
x    b) variation in Tails (gaussian)

x 2a) Single sink with discrete varying enrichment levels

[Following was unnecessary:
  2b) Multiple sinks with discrete enrichment levels
   a) RNG assign preference for each facility so that trade goes through
      	  for different enrichment levels each time
   b) For each not-chosen facility, set preference to zero for the timestep
   c) for this case a custom query is needed to provide total shipment table:
      {
         "facflow": "SELECT tl.Time AS Time,TOTAL(sub.qty) AS Quantity FROM timelist as tl LEFT JOIN ( SELECT t.simid AS simid,t.time as time,SUM(c.massfrac*r.quantity) as qty FROM transactions AS t JOIN resources as r ON t.resourceid=r.resourceid AND r.simid=t.simid JOIN agents as send ON t.senderid=send.agentid AND send.simid=t.simid JOIN agents as recv ON t.receiverid=recv.agentid AND recv.simid=t.simid JOIN compositions as c ON c.qualid=r.qualid AND c.simid=r.simid WHERE send.agentid=? AND recv.agentid=? GROUP BY t.time) AS sub ON tl.time=sub.time AND tl.simid=sub.simid GROUP BY tl.Time;"
	}

Retrieving SWUTimeSeries

Testing Results
---------------
- Variation in tails from 0.1-0.3% results in a SWU range of 237-396
(test_tails_on2.sqlite)
- HEU production of 0.03kg uses 6.8 SWU
(test_swu_heu.sqlite)
- 5 different enrichments 3,3.5,4,4.5,5% results in SWU range 142-292
(test_recipe_multi5x.sqlite)
