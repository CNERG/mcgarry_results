Goal
----
Dataset for UM containing power consumption and LEU shipped, where SWU is
not constrained and power consumption has gaussian variation.  Enrichment
level of LEU produced also varies with a discrete # of levels (3-5%).
Possibly also vary HEU amplitude.

Modifications
-------------
1) Create xml with correct facilities to simulate variation in power consumed
due to variation in tails assay.
    a) variation in LEU Qty requested (gaussian)
    b) variation in Tails (gaussian)

2a) Single sink with discrete varying enrichment levels
OR
2b) Multiple sinks with discrete enrichment levels
   a) RNG assign preference for each facility so that trade goes through
      	  for different enrichment levels each time
   b) For each not-chosen facility, set preference to zero for the timestep
   c) for this case a custom query is needed to provide total shipment table:
      {
         "facflow": "SELECT tl.Time AS Time,TOTAL(sub.qty) AS Quantity FROM timelist as tl LEFT JOIN ( SELECT t.simid AS simid,t.time as time,SUM(c.massfrac*r.quantity) as qty FROM transactions AS t JOIN resources as r ON t.resourceid=r.resourceid AND r.simid=t.simid JOIN agents as send ON t.senderid=send.agentid AND send.simid=t.simid JOIN agents as recv ON t.receiverid=recv.agentid AND recv.simid=t.simid JOIN compositions as c ON c.qualid=r.qualid AND c.simid=r.simid WHERE send.agentid=? AND recv.agentid=? GROUP BY t.time) AS sub ON tl.time=sub.time AND tl.simid=sub.simid GROUP BY tl.Time;"
	}

3) Add HEU facility
