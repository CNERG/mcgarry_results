Using RandomSink v1.2 (commit 16-Jul-2015) and Cyclus v1.3 to generate a set
of test data for UM to start working with. Features:

- 100 simIDs
- each sim is approx 2000 total timesteps - 1000 before diversion and 1000 after
- HEU diversion frequency and natural LEU variation are both being
time-seeded to be completely random.

** These simulations are not reproducible because I've used time_seed = system
time AND because the order of requests and bids is not currently deterministic
in Cyclus.  Future datasets will need these issues to be resolved before any
publications **
