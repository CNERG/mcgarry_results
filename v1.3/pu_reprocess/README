Simulations of Kr85 emissions from separations facilities.
Emissions of Kr85 occur on a daily timescale, so simulation is calibrated
to average single-day output for real facilities (using example numbers from
Kemp, Jour. Environ. Radioactivity, 2008)


reprocess.* (branch develop ?)
------------------------------
???

Concept: Visualize separations facility with multiple streams

Results:
cyclist_reprocess.xml
reprocess_diagram.png


One_source.*  (branch Random_sep) 
Analysis done with source branch of ~/git/data_analysis/Kr85_emissions.py
---------------------------------
2015-8-25

Concept: A separations facility has an undeclared stream of material
being diverted as weapons-grade Pu (possibly faulty premise).

Implementation: One separations facility with three streams: Pu, diverted,
waste. Post-processing tracks the emissions from Pu stream, showing variation.

Results:
Kr85_one_source.xml
one_source.sqlite - inspector signal is declared Pu production
one_source.mp4 - plots dispersion of Kr85 emission from the source
	       	 of the declared Pu stream


Multi_source.* (branch random_sink1.3, merged w/develop 27-aug)
Analysis done with multi_source branch of Kr85_emissions.py
---------------------------------------------------------------
2015-8-28

Concept: 3 separations facilities with Kr85 emissions signals, one of
which is clandestine (ie. weapons grade Pu produces different amplitude
Kr emissions for same quantity processed compared with reactor-grade).
Diffusion model: simple 1/r^2

Implementation: 3 sinks requesting material from one Pu source - sink
inventories are considered emission-sources.

Results:
Kr85_multi_source.xml
multi_source.sqlite - covert facility puffs Kr85 every 5 days
(multi_source_slow.sqlite - (no movie) covert facility puffs Kr85 every 20 days)
multi_source_1.mp4 - movie of just the covert facility's emissions
multi_source_2.mp4 - movie of just the emissions from declared facilities
multi_source_3.mp4 - composite movie with emissions from all 3 facilities

Concept: 3 separations facilities with Kr85 emissions signals, one of
which is clandestine (ie. weapons grade Pu produces different amplitude
Kr emissions for same quantity processed compared with reactor-grade).
Add wind to simple 1/r^2 diffusion model. Particle flux is not conserved
(ie. if wind is stronger than diffusion, then any 'flux' going against
the wind direction is 'lost'.)

Implementation: 3 sinks requesting material from one Pu source - sink
inventories are considered emission-sources.

Results:
(using multi_source.sqlite)
wind45_v15.mp4 - composite movie with emissions from all 3 facilities:
	       diffusion rate = 1.5,
	       wind speed 1.5*diffusion rate,
	       wind direction 45 degrees (off vertical)


Analysis done with simple_velocity branch of Kr85_emissions.py
proper_diffusion function has been added.

Concept: 3 separations facilities with Kr85 emissions signals, one of
which is clandestine (ie. weapons grade Pu produces different amplitude
Kr emissions for same quantity processed compared with reactor-grade).
Use a representative composite plume + puff diffusion model taken from
Handbook on Atmospheric Diffusion.  Wind is in the x-direction only.

Implementation: 3 sinks requesting material from one Pu source - sink
inventories are considered emission-sources.

Results:
(using multi_source.sqlite)
proper_difF_wind10x.mp4 - composite movie with emissions from all 3 facilities:
		       diffusion rate = 0.15,
	       	       wind speed 10*diffusion rate,

Other parameters (epsilon, time definition) are somewhat arbitrary. I tried
converting everything to kg per unit time (where time was not redefined), but
it did not converge.  It's possible that time must be explicitly converted
from sec to days, but I don't see why this is necessary.
