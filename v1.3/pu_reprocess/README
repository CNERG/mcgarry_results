Simulations of Kr85 emissions from separations facilities.
Emissions of Kr85 occur on a daily timescale, so simulation is calibrated
to average single-day output for real facilities (using example numbers from
Kemp, Jour. Environ. Radioactivity, 2008)


reprocess.* (branch develop ?)
------------------------------
???

Concept: Visualize separations facility with multiple streams

Results:
cyclist_reprocess.xml

One_source.*  (branch Random_sep) 
Analysis done with source branch of ~/git/data_analysis/Kr85_emissions.py
---------------------------------
2015-8-25

Concept: A separations facility has an undeclared stream of material
being diverted as weapons-grade Pu (possibly faulty premise).

Implementation: One separations facility with three streams: Pu, diverted,
waste. Post-processing tracks the emissions from Pu stream, showing variation.

Results:
Kr85_one_source.xml
one_source.sqlite - inspector signal is declared Pu production
one_source.mp4 - plots dispersion of Kr85 emission from the source
	       	 of the declared Pu stream


Multi_source.* (branch random_sink1.3, merged w/develop 27-aug)
Analysis done with multi_source branch of Kr85_emissions.py
---------------------------------------------------------------
2015-8-28

Concept: 3 separations facilities with Kr85 emissions signals, one of
which is clandestine (ie. weapons grade Pu produces different amplitude
Kr emissions for same quantity processed compared with reactor-grade)

Implementation: 3 sinks requesting material from one Pu source - sink
inventories are considered emission-sources.

results:
Kr85_multi_source.xml
multi_source.sqlite - covert facility puffs Kr85 every 5 days
(multi_source_slow.sqlite - (no movie) covert facility puffs Kr85 every 20 days)
multi_source_1.mp4 - movie of just the covert facility's emissions
multi_source_2.mp4 - movie of just the emissions from declared facilities
multi_source_3.mp4 - composite movie with emissions from all 3 facilities
