Test Scenarios

100 timesteps

Status Quo		Multi-Lateral
----------------------------------------
Enrichment    ++   	Enrichment     0
Sci Network  Low	Sci Network   ++
Conflict  Random	Conflict     Low


Goal: Does Status Quo behave as expected for extrema?
      Does Multi-lat behave as expected for extrema?
1) 2 States - All factors Constant = 1  (including conflict)
2) 2 States - All factors Constant = 10 (including conflict)
3) 2 States - All factors Constant = 1  (except conflict)

Notes: High Pursuit Score results in weapons building too quickly.
Need to add in a time delay/unpredictability due to acquire success.
