** Cycamore branch random_sink _v1.3**

Cyclus Core 1.3.0 (1.3.0-rc6-31-gc99f79b)

Dependencies:
   Boost    1_57
   Coin-Cbc 2.8
   Coin-Clp 1.15
   Hdf5     1.8.13-
   Sqlite3  3.8.8.2
   xml2     2.9.2
   xml++    <2.37
(updated 30-June-2015)

Goals:
-----
1) Confirm that conversion to Cyclus v1.3 is consistent with results from v1.2

Filename convention:
--------------------
HEU##p - HEU qty in kg (03 = 0.03kg)
(aq33 - average quantity of requested LEU material 33kg)
s## - sigma (gaussian variation in delta_LEU)
swu### - swu capacity
t### - simulation duration
E/R# - covert demand Every # or Randomly with average frequency of #

Description: LEU (34, 0.5, 5, 0) (avg qty,FWHM,pref,behav)

** Files with _E5_3#.sqlite are run with behavior_fns modified so that only n1 is chosen in RNG at all times. **
** Files with _R5_3#.sqlite are run with behavior_fns modified so that only n1 is chosen in RNG at all times. **

Potential Causes of Non-Determination:
-------------------------------------
x RNG is not deterministic
  -- tested directly (meg_fns/normal_dist.cc)
x v1.2 Random Sink was also not deterministic
  -- rebuild v1.2 and ran again. Everything was solid.
x Cyclus v1.3 is not deterministic
  -- rebuild cycamore v1.2 with Cyclus v1.3 and had no problems with repeatability.
x Cyclist is writing bad CSV files
  -- copying a raw sqlite file and reading the two versions in separate Cyclist sessions gave same result.
x Python is plotting wrong
  -- again, looking back at the re-made v1.2 results, everything worked fine.
x Behavior_fn not rebuilding after changes
  -- tried changing n1, n2 to ONLY n1 and everything changed as expected.
? New Enrichment is not deterministic (WHY?)
? Something else in cycamore v1.3 is not deterministic
? Enrichment facility is not calculating max SWU correctly (unlikely, does not explain all behavior)

Summary:
-------
EVERY: For n1 fixed, HEU is always correct. (As expected.)
       Delta 1=2=3 but 4 and 5 are each unique.
       Actually 4 and 5 have the same time frequency but different amplitudes.

RANDOM: For n1 fixed, 1=4=5, but 2 and 3 are unique.
	Actually 3 matches 1 from t=30-100. But not before.

THEREFORE:
- If RNG begins with HEU by default then it will always be the same for EVERY. Then delta should be the same too. NO.
- IF RNG begins with HEU by default then it will NOT be the same for RANDOM ??
- IF RNG sometimes begins with one and sometimes the other, then CHAOS will ensue.
 ** HOW can I make HEU for EVERY always match but nothing else????
