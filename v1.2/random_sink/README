Filename convention:
--------------------
HEU##p - HEU qty in kg (03 = 0.03kg)
(aq33 - average quantity of requested LEU material 33kg)
s## - sigma (gaussian variation in delta_LEU)
swu### - swu capacity
t### - simulation duration
E/R# - covert demand Every # or Randomly with average frequency of #


Goals:
-----
Create SWU-limited trading of variable amounts of HEU based on fluctuating requests
for LEU.  What is detection limit for HEU diversion on top of LEU signal?

1) Create (normal distribution) RandomSink with avg_qty = mean amount traded, sigma = standard deviation
2) Constant HEU trade with small sigma for LEU (uncapacitated)
3) Constant HEU request with ND-traded-LEU (capacitated)
   	    - can we see variation in HEU supplied based on LEU qty?
4) Iterate: high-priority EveryX HEU request with low priority ND-traded-LEU
   	    Implementation: 3 sinks - 'Measured LEU signature' - LEU (34, 0.5, 5, 0) (qty,FWHM,pref,behav)
	    		      	    - 'Natl LEU Variation' - HEU (1,0,0,0)
				    - 'HEU diversion' - HEU (1,0,10,r5)
	    - can we see signature of HEU trades in LEU signal?
	    - what is threshold for detection for a given variance in LEU?
	    - Parameterize meanLEU/meanHEU, sigmaLEU/meanHEU somehow scaled to capacity

For the cases above - calculate meanLEU/meanHEU (should be constant fn of SWU), stdevLEU/meanHEU (??)
Signature of trade in Cyclical Variation - Fourier transform?
Signature of trade in Random Variation - What is likelihood any given LEU qty is a normal variation? (Bayesian!)
	  - need to make a trade of high priority HEU that causes LEU to dip independent of the natural LEU variation
	  (make a 3rd 'HEU sink' to represent the natural variation, then add the diversion HEU sink on top of that)

*****************
Updated random_sink branch of Cycamore so that random seed is 1 by default (rather than seeded on time).  
Now need to rerun some of the simulations to get deterministic results. (moved previous results to non_determ/ )

Summary 4-15-2015:  For some reason, the E5 cvs data from the E5 runs was bad. Don't know if it was just the csv file or also the cyclus file.
Looking at another dataset (E5_n2), I see that the Total thruput does not show many indications of diversion where the Delta does. Maybe look
at this all again with a larger diversion signal to make sure it's working?  All of this work is in the check_reproducibility notebook.
